Cardiovascular Disease dataset

Based on The World Health Organization (WHO), Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are disorders related to the heart and blood vessels. 

Here we used the dataset consisting of 70 000 records of patients data, 11 features + target, to build models predicting CVDs. Also, after preprocessing the data, we did exploratory data analysis to figure out the risk factors of CVDs and their effects on CVDs.
