## Chapter 1: Introduction of Cardiovascular Disease:

Based on The World Health Organization (WHO), Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are disorders related to the heart and blood vessels. The diseases mainly caused by fatty deposits plaque builds up on the inner walls of the blood vessels which prevent prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain. 

![The process of fatty plaque formation.](CVD picture.jpg)


According to 2016 report, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States (Benjamin et al., 2019). Around 80% of CVD deaths are a heart attack and stroke. The cause of cardiovascular diseases is usually the presence of a combination of risk factors, such as unhealthy diet, obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol.

Body mass index (BMI) is a value calculated from the weight and height of a person, the equation is kg(kilogram)/m(meter)^2. It is a measurement to assess a person’s total amount of body fat. As measuring BMI only needs a person’s weight and height, it has been widely used in public health and clinical settings.

Since there are many reports indicated that the cause of cardiovascular diseases is associated with our BMI and lifestyle. Therefore, we want to evaluate whether these factors truly correlate with the developing of the disease. 
 
 
## Chapter 2: Description of Data and Exploratory Data Analysis

### 2.1 Source Data
The source data for our EDA is a CSV containing 70,000 records of patients data in 12 features: age, height, weight, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, and presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. (https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cardio <- read.csv("cardio_train.csv", sep = ";")
cardio$gender <- as.factor(cardio$gender)
cardio$smoke <- as.factor(cardio$smoke)
cardio$alco <- as.factor(cardio$alco)
cardio$cholesterol <- as.factor(cardio$cholesterol)
cardio$gluc <- as.factor(cardio$gluc)
cardio$active <- as.factor(cardio$active)
cardio$cardio <- as.factor(cardio$cardio)
str(cardio)
```
### 2.2 Preprocessing Data

We noticed that variable 'age' is int(day), which were converted into int(years).As height and weight individually do not mean much to patients' health, so we calculated Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women, and added it as a feature. Also column 'id' was droped.
```{r, echo=F}
cardio <- subset(cardio, select=-c(id))
cardio$age <- round((cardio$age)/365)
cardio$bmi <- cardio$weight/((cardio$height/100)^2)
summary(cardio)
```

We noticed that the min value of systolic blood pressure(ap_hi) and diastolic blood pressure (ap_lo) are negative values, which do not make sense. In addition, diastolic blood pressure is supposed to be lower than systolic blood pressure. The data were further cleaned based on these crterion.

```{r, echo=F}
cardio <- cardio[which(cardio$ap_hi > 0), ]
cardio <- cardio[which(cardio$ap_lo > 0), ]
cardio <- cardio[which(cardio$ap_lo < cardio$ap_hi), ]
```

Then the distribution of age, height, weight, ap_hi and ap_lo was checked.

```{r, echo=F}
library('ggplot2')
ggplot(data=cardio, aes(x=age))+
  geom_histogram(fill="orange", col = "black", binwidth = 5)+
  ggtitle("Histogram of Age")+
  xlab("Age") + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5, size = 14))
ggplot(data=cardio, aes(x=height))+

  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5, size = 14))

  ylab("Count") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5, size = 14))
ggplot(data=cardio, aes(x=ap_hi))+
  geom_histogram(fill="blue", col = "black", binwidth = 10)+
  ggtitle("Histogram of Systolic Blood Pressure")+
  xlab("Systolic blood pressure") + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5, size = 14))
ggplot(data=cardio, aes(x=ap_lo))+
  geom_histogram(fill="red", col = "black", binwidth = 10)+
  ggtitle("Histogram of Diastolic Blood Pressure")+
  xlab("Diastolic blood pressure") + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5, size = 14))
```

The histogram of age shows that there are only few observation for age<35, which could not represent the population of age<35, so the observations with age<35 were droped. For height, weight, ap_hi, and ap_lo, the histograms were way skewed by some extreme outliers, which were droped in this step.

```{r outlierKD_def, include=FALSE}
# modified to allow prompt-free run-through
outlierKD <- function(dt, var, rmv=NULL) { 
     var_name <- eval(substitute(var),eval(dt))
     na1 <- sum(is.na(var_name))
     m1 <- mean(var_name, na.rm = T)
     sd1 <- sd(var_name,na.rm = T)
     par(mfrow=c(2, 2), oma=c(0,0,3,0))
     boxplot(var_name, main="With outliers")
     hist(var_name, main="With outliers", xlab=NA, ylab=NA)
     outlier <- boxplot.stats(var_name)$out
     mo <- mean(outlier)

     cat("Mean of the outliers:", round(mo, 2), "n")
     m2 <- mean(var_name, na.rm = T)
     cat("Mean without removing outliers:", round(m1, 2), "n")
     cat("Mean if we remove outliers:", round(m2, 2), "n")
     #
     if(is.null(rmv)) { 
       response <- readline(prompt="Do you want to remove outliers and to replace with NA? [yes/no]: ") 
     } else {
       if (rmv=='y'|rmv=='yes'|rmv=='Y'|rmv=='Yes'|rmv=='YES'|rmv==TRUE ) { response = 'y' } else { response = 'n' }
     }
     #
     if(response == "y" | response == "yes"){
          dt[as.character(substitute(var))] <- invisible(var_name)
          assign(as.character(as.list(match.call())$dt), dt, envir = .GlobalEnv)
          cat("Outliers successfully removed", "n")
          return(invisible(dt))
     } else{
          cat("Nothing changed", "n")
          return(invisible(var_name))
     }
}
```
```{r, include=FALSE}
cardio <- cardio[which(cardio$age > 35), ]
outlierKD(cardio, height, 'y')
outlierKD(cardio, weight, 'y')
outlierKD(cardio, ap_hi, 'y')
outlierKD(cardio, ap_lo, 'y')
cardio <- na.omit(cardio)
```

The distribution of age, height, weight, ap_hi and ap_lo was checked again after outliers removed.

### 2.3 Correlations among Different Variables

The correlation matrix was displayed to get an idea of the correlations among different variables.

```{r, echo=F}
library("corrplot")
ccor<-cor(cardio[c("age", "bmi", "ap_hi", "ap_lo")])
corrplot(ccor)
```

We noticed that bmi is positively correlated with both ap_hi and ap_lo; ap_hi is positively correlated with age;and ap_hi and ap_lo are of course highly positively correlated.

## Chapter 3: Cardio
### 3.1 SMART Question

What are the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases? Is gender, BMI, cholesterol level, glucose level, smoking, alcohol over-consumption and lack of exercise correlated to the development of cardiovascular disease?

### 3.2 Basic analyze

First, we categorize BMI values into 5 groups, starting from numerical value ranging (1-10), and then add the numerical value by 10, sequentially. Chi-square test is being used as the preferred method, as it shows the correlation between cardiovascular disease and BMI, age, cholesterol level, glucose level, smoking behavior, alcohol over-consumption, and lack of exercise. 


```{r, groupbyBMI2, echo=F}
#cardio1 <- subset(cardio, age>35)
cardio$bmiGroup <- cut(cardio$bmi, breaks = c(0, 18.5, 25, 35, 45, 55), labels = c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4"), right = FALSE)
cardio$bmiGroup <- as.factor(cardio$bmiGroup)
```

```{r groupbyAge1, echo=F}
labs <- c(paste(seq(35, 65, by = 10), seq(44, 74, by =10 ), sep = "-"))
cardio$ageGroup <- cut(cardio$age, breaks = c(seq(35, 74, by = 10), Inf), labels = labs, right = FALSE)
```

```{r, chi-test1, echo=F, warning=F}
#cardio-bmi
cardio_bmi = table(cardio$bmiGroup,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_bmi)
chitest
#cardio-glucose
cardio_glucose = table(cardio$gluc,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_glucose)
chitest
#cardio-smoke
cardio_smoke = table(cardio$smoke,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_smoke)
chitest
#cardio-alco
cardio_alco = table(cardio$alco,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_alco)
chitest
#cardio-active
cardio_active = table(cardio$active,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_active)
chitest
#cardio-age
cardio_age = table(cardio$ageGroup,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_age)
chitest
#cardio-cholesterol
cardio_cholesterol = table(cardio$cholesterol,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_cholesterol)
chitest
```

The null hypothesis is rejected as all p-values are small. All factors indicated above are considered to be risk factors of cardiovascular disease. 

In addition to Chapter 2, a bar plot is generated to show the relationship between age and the onset of cardiovascular disease. 

```{r, barplot, echo=F}
ggplot(cardio,aes(x=age)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(cardio)),position="fill")
```

As the bar plot shows, the number of elderly with cardiovascular disease is higher than the number of younger people with cardiovascular disease. 
We will discuss how age may affect cardiovascular disease in further detail in Chapter 5. 


## Chapter 4: BMI
### 4.1 SMART Question

What is the relationship between BMI and cardiovascular diseas and what factors will affect bmi? 

```{r, groupbyBMI1, echo=F}
#cardio1 <- subset(cardio, age>35)
cardio$bmiGroup <- cut(cardio$bmi, breaks = c(0, 18.5, 25, 35, 45, 55), labels = c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4"), right = FALSE)
cardio$bmiGroup <- as.factor(cardio$bmiGroup)
```

### 4.2 Is that bmi affect cardiovascular disease?

A bar plot is generated to show the relationship between age and the onset of cardiovascular disease.


```{r bmi_cardio1, echo=F}
ggplot(cardio, aes(x=bmiGroup)) + 
geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(cardio)), position="fill") + 
labs(title="Proportion of cardio per bmiGroup",x="bmiGroup", y = "proportion")
```

By comparing the BMI group with the incidence of getting cardiovascular disease, we conclude that people with higher BMI are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. Likewise, people with cardiovascular disease are also more likely to have higher BMI.

In addition, we subset cardiovascular disease group, with [cardio0] for people without cardiovascular disease and [cardio1] for people with cardiovascular disease. Then, we compare the mean and histogram between people with cardiovascular disease and without cardiovascular disease. 


```{r, echo=F}
cardio0 <- subset(cardio, cardio == 0)
cardio1 <- subset(cardio, cardio == 1)
cardio1$zbmi <- scale(cardio1$bmi)
```


```{r, echo=F}
mean(cardio0$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(cardio1$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(cardio0$bmi, col=c("#00ff00"))
hist(cardio1$bmi, col=c("#ff00ff"))
```

From both mean and histogram, we observe that people with cardiovascular diseases tend to have higher BMI than people without cardiovascular diseases. We conclude BMI and cardiovascular have correlation. 

We will go on with the hypothesis that risk factors of high BMI value will also be the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. 

### 4.3 Basic analysis of BMIgroup

We fisrt use chi-test to see the relationship between BMIgroup and glucose, smoke, alchol level, exercise.

```{r, chi-test, echo=F, warning=F}
#bmi-glucose
bmi_glucose = table(cardio$gluc,cardio$bmiGroup)
chitest = chisq.test(bmi_glucose)
chitest
#bmi-smoke
bmi_smoke = table(cardio$smoke,cardio$bmiGroup)
chitest = chisq.test(bmi_smoke)
chitest
#bmi-alco
bmi_alco = table(cardio$alco,cardio$bmiGroup)
chitest = chisq.test(bmi_alco)
chitest
#bmi-active
bmi_active = table(cardio$active,cardio$bmiGroup)
chitest = chisq.test(bmi_active)
chitest
```

The null hypothesis for high glucose level, smoking behavior, alcohol over-consumption, and lack of exercise are rejected as all p-values are small. We conclude high BMI is more correlated to cardiovascular disease. 

In addition, the analysis indicates BMI level is associated with the presence of cardiovascular disease. Smoking behavior, alcohol-consumption, and glucose level are also associated with the onset of cardiovascular disease.

Furthermore, we fail to reject H0 as the p-value for activity level is greater than 0.05. There is no impact on BMI among people who are active and people who are not active. 


### 4.4 Conclusion of BMI

We use t-test and boxplot to analyze BMI and subset each risk factors. Specifically, we subset women and men for gender, smoke (0) and not smoke (1) for smoking behavior, noalco (0) and alco (1) for alcohol consumption, and noactive (0) and active (1) for activity level. Boxplot helps us to find groups with higher BMI.

```{r, ttest, echo=F}
#bmi-cardio
cardio0 <- subset(cardio, cardio == 0)
cardio1 <- subset(cardio, cardio == 1)
bmitest <- t.test(cardio0$bmi,cardio1$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ cardio, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
#bmi-gender
women <- subset(cardio, gender == 1)
men <- subset(cardio, gender == 2)
bmitest <- t.test(women$bmi,men$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ gender, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
#bmi-smoke
not_smoke <- subset(cardio, smoke == 0)
smoke <- subset(cardio, smoke == 1)
bmitest <- t.test(not_smoke$bmi,smoke$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ smoke, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
#bmi-alco
noalco <- subset(cardio, alco == 0)
alco <- subset(cardio, alco == 1)
bmitest <- t.test(noalco$bmi,alco$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ alco, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
#bmi-active
noactive <- subset(cardio, active == 0)
active <- subset(cardio, active == 1)
bmitest <- t.test(noactive$bmi,active$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ active, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
```

We conclude that no smoking, alcohol consumption, and female gender are contributed to higher BMI. In addition, the discussed characteristics has less impact on BMI among people who are active than people who are not active. Because cardiovascular diseases have correlation with BMI, People who no smoking, drink alcohol, and female gender also be the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases.


## Chapter 5: Age
### 5.1 SMART Question

Are the mean values of different factors such as systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure same across age group?

### 5.2.1 Are systolic blood pressure the same across all age group

We mention age and cardio diseases have relationship. We we discuss about age and bloos pressure.

H0: The mean values of Systolic blood pressure are the same across all agegroup.

H1: The mean values of Systolic blood pressure are different across age groups.

ANOVA and TukeyHSD are used to test the hypothesis and calculate the p-value. The diagram blow summarizes the results.


```{r groupbyAge, echo=F}
labs <- c(paste(seq(35, 65, by = 10), seq(44, 74, by =10 ), sep = "-"))
cardio$ageGroup <- cut(cardio$age, breaks = c(seq(35, 74, by = 10), Inf), labels = labs, right = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=F}
#age-systolic blood pressure
aov <- aov(ap_hi ~ ageGroup, data = cardio)
boxplot(ap_hi ~ ageGroup, data = cardio ,main="Systolic blood pressure vs age",ylab = "Systolic blood pressure", xlab = "age", col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff","#ff0000") )
summary(aov)
```

```{r tukeyHSD1, echo=F}
tukeyAoV <- TukeyHSD(aov)
tukeyAoV
```

Based on tukeyHSD, we conclude that people in age (65 ~74) and (55 ~64) have different systolic blood pressure.

The null hypothesis is rejected as all p-values are small. We conclude that the mean values of Systolic blood pressure are different across all age groups.

### 5.3 Are diastolic blood pressure the same across all age group

H0: The mean values of diastolic blood pressure are the same across all agegroup.

H1: The mean values of diastolic blood pressure are  different across age groups. 

ANOVA and TukeyHSD are used to test the hypothesis and calculate the p-value. The diagram blow summarizes the results.


```{r, echo=F}
#age - diastolic blood pressure
aov <- aov(ap_lo ~ ageGroup, data = cardio)
boxplot(ap_lo ~ ageGroup, data = cardio ,main="Diastolic blood pressure vs age",ylab = "Diastolic blood pressure", xlab = "age", col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff","#ff0000") )
summary(aov)
```

```{r tukeyHSD, echo=F}
tukeyAoV <- TukeyHSD(aov)
tukeyAoV
```

Based on tukeyHSD, we conclude that people in age (65~74) and (55~64) have different diastolic blood pressure. 

The null hypothesis is rejected as all p-values are small. We conclude that the mean values of diastolic blood pressure are different across all age groups.

We can conclude that age will affect blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the incidence of getting cardiovascular disease. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

loadPkg = function(x) { if (!require(x,character.only=T, quietly =T)) { install.packages(x,dep=T,repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org"); if(!require(x,character.only=T)) stop("Package not found") } }

```

```{r groupbyAge6}

cardio3$ageGroup <- cut(cardio3$age, breaks = c(seq(35, 74, by = 10), Inf), labels = labs, right = FALSE)
```

## Chapter 6: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Method
Being overweight or obese substantially increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, researchers don’t always agree which method is best for quantifying whether an individual is “too” overweight. So, this section will analyze if the BMI is the best meacurement at predicting risk.

### 6.1 SMART Question
Is BMI the best measurement at predicting risk in every individual? If not, is there another measurement to help to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease?

### 6.2 Cardio in Different BMI Group
To find the adult weight classification, see which of these BMI ranges the weight falls into:
```{r groupbyBMI6}
cardio3$bmiGroup <- cut(cardio3$bmi, breaks = c(0, 18.5, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, Inf), labels = c("underWeight", "normalWeight", "overWeight", "obese", "severelyObese", "morbidlyObese", "superObese"), right = FALSE)
```

BMI  |   adult weight classification  |  
-------|-----|
[0, 18.5) kg/m^2  | underWeight | 
[18.5, 25) kg/m^2  | normalWeight | 
[25, 30) kg/m^2  | overWeight |
[30, 35) kg/m^2  | obese |
[35, 45) kg/m^2  | severelyObese |
[45, 50) kg/m^2  | morbidlyObese |
[50, Inf) kg/m^2  | superObese |

```{r bmi_cardio6}
ggplot(data=cardio3, mapping=aes(x=bmiGroup,fill=factor(cardio)))+
geom_bar(stat="count",width=0.5,position='fill')+
scale_fill_manual(values=c('#E5E7E9','#E74C3C'))+
theme_minimal()+
labs(title="Proportion of cardio per bmiGroup",x="BMI Group", y = "proportion")+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1)) 
```


The bar chart pressents the incidence of cardiovascular disease in groups of different BMI levels. From the figure we can see that before the severelyObese level, as the BMI parameter continues to increase, the incidence of cardiovascular disease gradually increases. When the BMI level exceeds severelyObese level, the morbidity rate tends to be stable and has a slow downward trend. 
However, BMI is not always accurate in every individual. It overestimates body fat in people with a lot of muscle mass and tends to underestimate it in elderly people. So, the idea of using waist circumference as a risk predictor stems from the fact comes up.

### 6.3 Predicted Waist Circumference by BMI

Carrying excess body fat around your middle is more of a health risk than if weight is on your hips and thighs. In that case, waist circumference is a better estimate of visceral fat, the dangerous internal fat that coats the organs.

An initial model expressed the regression of WC on BMI in the following form:

WCi = b0 + b1BMIi + b2AGEi + b3BLACKi + b4HISPi + ei

where i indexes individuals, WCi is waist circumference for individual i, BMIi is body mass index, AGEi is current age (in years), BLACKi is an indicator for African-American, HISPi is an indicator for Hispanic ethnicity, and ei is the residual.

For women the pattern was better summarized by using one constant for age<35years and a separate intercept and slope for age≥35years. Thus, the model for women was

WCi = c0 + c1BMIi + c2I{AGEi ≥ 35} + c3AGEi × I{AGEi ≥ 35} + c4BLACKi + c5HISPi + ei

where I{B} is an indicator function: I{B} = 1 when B is true and 0 otherwise.

After the prediction, the sample of the data is as follows:
```{r predict_waist}
predicted_men_waist <- function(bmi, age){
    b0 = 22.61306
    b1BMI = 2.520738*(bmi)
    b2AGE = 0.1583812*(age)

### 6.4 Cut Off Line and Obese

Studies have shown that a waist circumference of 95cm or more in men, and of 88cm or more in women, is associated with elevated cardiovascular risk. So, we use these parameters as cuf off line for each gender.

A Body Mass Index of 25kg/m^2 or more is defined as obese, which means the risk of having cardiovascular disease is higher. 

At the same time, two parameters are defined here: "safe area" and "warning area". When both waist circumference and BMI parameters are lower than the cut off line and obese parameters, the result is safe area, otherwise the result is warnning area.

The statistical results of cardiovascular disease after cut off and obese classification are as follows:
```{r bmi cut_off}
obesed <- function(bmi){
  ifelse(bmi < 25, "normal weight", "obese")
}
cardio3$obese <- obesed(cardio3$bmi)


cutOff_men <- function(predict_waist){
  ifelse(predict_waist > 95, "over cut off", "below cut off")
}
cutOff_women <- function(predict_waist){
  ifelse(predict_waist > 88, "over cut off", "below cut off")
}
cutOff <- function(gender, predict_waist){
  ifelse(gender == 2, cutOff_men(predict_waist), cutOff_women(predict_waist))
}
cardio3$cut_off <- cutOff(cardio3$gender, cardio3$predict_waist)


bmi_waist_men <- function(predict_waist, bmi){
  ifelse((predict_waist < 95) & (bmi < 25), "safe area", "warning area")
}
bmi_waist_women <- function(predict_waist, bmi){
  ifelse((predict_waist < 88) & (bmi < 25), "safe area", "warning area")
}
bmiWaist <- function(gender, predict_waist, bmi){
  ifelse(gender == 2, bmi_waist_men(predict_waist, bmi), bmi_waist_women(predict_waist, bmi))
}
cardio3$bmi_waist <- bmiWaist(cardio3$gender, cardio3$predict_waist, cardio3$bmi)
```

```{r list_gender_cutoff_cardio}
summary_combine <- cardio3 %>% 
  count(gender, obese, cut_off, bmi_waist, cardio)

knitr::kable(summary_combine)
```

From the three safe/warning area vs cardiovascular disease bar plots, the risk of having cardiovascular disease in all genders is 15.4% if he/she is in safe area, and 34% if he/she is in warning area. In only women section, the risk of having cardiovascular disease is 14.9% if she is in safe area, and 34.7% if she is in warning area. In only men section, the risk of having cardiovascular disease is 16.4% if he is in safe area, and 32.6% if he is in warning area.

### 6.6 Conclusion

* From the three different measurements above (Cut Off Line vs Cardiovascular Disease; Obese vs Cardiovascular Disease; Cut Off Line + Obese vs Cardiovascular Disease), we could see that all of the three measurements work well to help people predict the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the Cut Off Line + Obese vs Cardiovascular Disease measurement method performs best. 
* If you just have your weight and height data and want to predict the disease in an easy way, you can just use them to calculate the BMI value, and use the Obese vs Cardiovascular Disease measurement. Although this method of prediction is not the most accurate in terms of results, it can also be used because the required data is relatively simple and there is no major problem with the overall trend of the prediction results.
* If you want to predict the risk in a more accurate result, you can also measure your waist circumference while measuring your height and weight.



## Chapter 7: Project 1 Conclusion and Discussion

In summary, our analysis indicated that BMI level and smoking are associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, age, gender, smoking, blood glucose level, and alcohol use have an impact on BMI level. 

We further subgroup the BMI value into weight classes cataloged by NIH. The plot showed that higher BMI values tend to have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Another way to measure in Cardiovascular disease risk is through waist circumference (WC). Abdominal obesity is a well-researched risk factor for CVD and is being suggested to be used in adjunct with BMI to determine a person's CVD risk. We further predict WC value using a specific formula and set the parameter for plotting (Bozeman et al., 2012), our result indicated that WC value is also a good variable for predicting cardiovascular diseases. 

There are many risk factors in Cardiovascular diseases, studies suggested that the genetic variances in patients have an impact on the development of the diseases. Furthermore, a persons’ family with cardiovascular diseases also increased their risk (Kathiresan & Srivastava, 2012). According to Harvard Health Publishing, the rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease vary among people of different races and living countries. Therefore, the dataset could include patients’ family background, race, and ethnicity as additional variables for analyzing cardiovascular diseases.

The data being collected in this project, including gender, smoking behavior, alcohol over-consumption, glucose level, cholesterol level, and activity level, were all categorical data from the raw dataset. Specifically, BMI values were categorized into 5 groups, starting from (1-10), and then added the numerical value by 10, sequentially. The age was processed in the same way, except being categorized into more groups. 

To further analyze the risk factors of cardiovascular disease in next project, we will use the logistic function to analyze the relation between BMI (as numerical data) and other risk factors. Age will be processed as numerical data, rather than categorical, to perform a 2-sample t-test. 

BMI values have a higher correlation with cardiovascular disease. Risk factors that contribute to high BMI value also contribute to the onset of cardiovascular disease. From Chapter 3, we conclude that people with cardiovascular disease, female gender, no smoking and alcohol over-consumption behavior, and inactive, tend to have higher BMI value. From chapter 2-5, we conclude elderly people are more likely to have higher BMI values, and people who have higher BMI values have a higher risk of having cardiovascular disease. At the same time, in chapter 6, we listed three methods for predicting cardiovascular disease and found that the best prediction method is: use bmi and waist circumference. Having these two data can help people judge the probability of getting sick according to their physical condition.

The research of this project is quite rewarding, but at the same time it can still be further researched in some aspects, so, on the next project, we will focus more on the direct relationship between unhealthy lifestyles and cardiovascular disease.
